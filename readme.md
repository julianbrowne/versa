As in vice versa

## History

This is a fork of `https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/` which is in turn a copy of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

## Changes

- no answers will be words with duplicate letters
- but guess words with duplicate letters is allowed
- the list of possible words (3000) is british english
- some minor cosmetic changes to the UI

## Rules

These are unchanged from Word Master / Wordle

- The objective is to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word
- You have 6 guesses to fine the correct word
- Each guess can be any valid word, but not random characters
- After each guess, the guessed letters will turn grey, green, or orange
- Green means the letter is correct and in the correct position
- Yellow means the letter is correct, but in the wrong position
- Grey means that letter is not anywhere in the answer
