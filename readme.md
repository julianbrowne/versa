## Rules

These are unchanged from Word Master / Wordle

- The objective is to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word
- You have 6 guesses to fine the correct word
- Each guess can be any valid word, but not random characters
- After each guess, the guessed letters will turn grey, green, or orange
- Green means the letter is correct and in the correct position
- Orange means the letter is correct, but in the wrong position
- Grey means that letter is not anywhere in the answer
